# Prediction Of Earthquakes In Indonesia Using Prophet Forecasting Model

## ✨ About The Project

Indonesia is one of the countries where earthquakes often occur. This is because Indonesia is located in the Ring of Fire region, which is formed from the movement of tectonic plates under the earth's crust. Indonesia is also located between the meeting of 3 earth plates namely the Indo-Australian plate, the Pacific plate and the Eurasian plate. Therefore, Indonesia has many volcanoes both active and inactive and as a result of the movement of these plates Indonesia often experiences eruptions from volcanoes to earthquakes. The analysis was carried out using Indonesian earthquake data for 15 years, from 2008 to 2023 that can be accessed through this [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kekavigi/earthquakes-in-indonesia).
The purpose of this study is to predict the strength of earthquakes in Indonesia in the coming year and to determine the maximum earthquake strength that will occur in 2024.
The dataset used is earthquake data in Indonesia from 2008 to 2023. Some of the attributes used in this dataset are:
* date: the date of the earthquake
* ot: time the earthquake occurred
* lat: latitude of the location where the earthquake occurred
* lon: longitude of the location where the earthquake occurred
* depth : depth of the earthquake that occurred
* mag : strength of the earthquake that occurred
* remark : location of the earthquake
